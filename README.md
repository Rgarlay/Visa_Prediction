# Visa Prediction Classification Using Machine Learning.

## Project Overview:

This project aims to predict the outcome of visa applications using machine learning. The system takes a number of inputs from the user about their profile and makes a prediction, whether that person would get approval or rejection on their US visa application.

- Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask

### Project Description:
Kaggle.com provides a dataset of 1500 instances, with a number of numerical and categorical features. We use Pandas and seaborn to visualise the data distribution like 'prevailing_wage' and 'no_of_employees_of_organisation'. Then, an array of classifier models (xgboost, SVC,Adaboost, Random Forest etc.). Model is evaluated based on recall score so as to improve true positive case.For Adaboost classifier, it is 0.90 and hence it is choice for training the model.
